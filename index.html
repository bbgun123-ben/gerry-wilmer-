      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="about-grid">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p><strong>Nature and memory are at the heart of my art.</strong> I hold an MA in Fine Art (Painting) and have been sketching the world around me for as long as I can remember. I like to draw outdoors using pen and watercolours in small sketchbooks, then back in my studio I paint on a larger scale using acrylics on paper and oil on canvas:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. My subjects are mainly <em>trees, landscapes, and seascapes</em>, inspired by the places I’ve been and the moments I treasure.</p>
          <p>I often fill every inch of my sketchbooks – even across the binding! – with quick pen lines and splashes of watercolor. My father always encouraged me to <q>do something</q> with those sketches, but he used to tease me that I painted on both sides of the page so I could never tear them out:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. After he passed away, I decided to honor his memory by finally sharing those hidden sketchbook scenes with the world.</p>
          <p>In 2019, I began producing fine art prints from my sketchbook drawings. I found a printer who could reproduce the pages as high-quality Giclée prints, even enlarging some of them – and suddenly those fast, sketchy lines and watercolor washes came alive with a new vibrancy at a larger size:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}! It was like seeing my memories grow brighter. Now I’m thrilled to offer these prints (and even greeting cards) so others can enjoy a little piece of those moments too.</p>
          <p>When I’m not painting in my St Albans studio, you’ll find me out in nature – wandering through a forest or along the coast with my sketchbook in hand, probably with ink-stained fingers and a happy heart. Art for me is not just a picture on the wall; it’s a story, a feeling, and a connection to the beautiful world we live in. Thank you for letting me share my stories with you.</p>
